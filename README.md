# Youtube-trending-video-analysis

# Intro
Youtube is the most popular platform in the world, and YouTube provides something of interest for creators, viewers, and advertisers.
in this project we try to be an aspiring YouTuber and the dream is for one of future videos to be trending. In order
to do so, I want to get some insights from the past trending videos on YouTube.
we are analyzing data on daily trending YouTube videos. Given YouTubeâ€™s large library of videos, it is important to filter videos to different users.

# Objective
Summary regarding the common factors of the trending videos, some
things that I could think of:
- specific topic/category that the video falls onto
- who uploaded these videos
- what are written on the title, tags, or description
- the engagement metrics (views, likes, dislikes, comments)
